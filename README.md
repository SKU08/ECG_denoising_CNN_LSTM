# ECG_denoising_CNN_LSTM
 A hybrid neural network combining CNN and LSTM layers enhances ECG signal classification by capturing both spatial (waveform amplitude, shape) and temporal (event sequence) features. This approach improves feature extraction and denoising, resulting in higher classification accuracy, ideal for sequence-based tasks like ECG analysis
